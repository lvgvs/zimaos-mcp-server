# Status

Phase 1 — ZimaOS MCP Server. This file is written so a fresh implementation chat can resume
without prior conversation context. Read `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT.md` first; they are
authoritative.

## Current phase / milestone

- **Phase:** Phase 1 — **complete** (completion-correction pass applied). All Phase 1 acceptance
  criteria that can be completed safely have been completed and verified. No Phase 2 work has
  been started.
- **Current milestone:** Manager review corrections closed: `docs/RESEARCH.md` reconciled against
  live v1.7.1 behavior, full live MCP integration matrix executed on the production container
  artifact (read + permissions + control), README client connection example added, immutable
  GHCR commit tags implemented and documented.

## Git / repository

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Repository URL:** https://github.com/lvgvs/zimaos-mcp-server (**private**, per Phase 1 rule)
- **HEAD:** this file is the final status-record commit of the correction pass; verify with
  `git log -1 --oneline`. The implementation corrections it records are in the commits listed
  under "Correction-pass commits" below (each SHA is stable and pushed).

## Correction-pass commits (this session, all on `main`, all pushed)

- `docs(research): correct containers/healthcheck findings against live v1.7.1` — reconciles
  `docs/RESEARCH.md` with a secret-safe raw re-probe of the disposable VM (see "Live API shape
  re-probe" below).
- `ci(ghcr): tag every published build with immutable sha-<GITHUB_SHA>` — `.github/workflows/ghcr-publish.yml`.
- `docs(readme): add MCP client connection example and GHCR tag strategy` — `README.md`.
- This status-record commit (final HEAD of the pass).

## Committed & pushed milestones (all on `main`, all pushed)

- Core implementation (`a3cd9e8`): strict TypeScript MCP server with typed ZimaOS client (login,
  bearer session, auto re-login on 401), domain services (apps/system), permission layer (app
  control disabled by default), Phase 1 tool set, authenticated Streamable HTTP transport +
  `/health`.
- Mocked test milestone (`7396929`): 52 vitest cases across 5 suites with a shared fake-fetch
  harness; covers config validation, client session behavior, permission layer, MCP tools over
  InMemoryTransport, and the HTTP transport (auth rejection, health readiness, authenticated round
  trip). Includes the `probeComposeAppHealth` fix.
- Docs handoff (`1bd0cf1`, corrected by `0b292e3`).
- Docker packaging (`acc8051`): multi-stage, non-root, prod-deps-only `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore`.
  Committed only after the production image was built and live-exercised.
- Deploy Compose (`6bfe1ce`): `deploy/zimaos/docker-compose.yml`, paste-ready for a ZimaOS Custom
  App (host-gateway networking, no privileged socket).
- CI + GHCR workflows (`6da18f6`): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/ghcr-publish.yml`.
  Neither depends on the disposable VM; no VM credentials in Actions.
- Docs (`a408e0d`): `README.md`, Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, `.env.example`, host-gateway research note in
  `docs/RESEARCH.md`.
- Status progress record (`0797d3e`).
- Formatting normalization (`e16ba21`) and README tool-list correction (`e612d91`).
- Phase 1 completion status (`f7698c3`), then manager commit `90385b2` (AGENTS.md tracked-file
  mutation safety rules) — local checkout fast-forwarded to it before this pass.

## Automated test status (exact, re-run for the correction pass)

- **5 files / 52 tests — all passing** (mocked, no network). `vitest run` → "Test Files 5 passed",
  "Tests 52 passed".

## Full local quality gates — ALL PASSING (re-run against the committed tree)

- `npx prettier --check .` — **pass** ("All matched files use Prettier code style!"). One
  pre-existing non-conforming line in this file at HEAD was fixed by this rewrite.
- `npm run lint` (`eslint .`) — **pass** (0 errors).
- `npm run typecheck` (`tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`, strict) — **pass**.
- Test type check (`npx tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`, strict) — **pass**.
- `npm test` — **52/52 pass**.
- `npm run build` (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`) — **passes**; emits `dist/` (gitignored).
- Docker image build from the committed tree — **success** (multi-stage, non-root; no BuildKit
  frontend dependency).
- Compose validation (`docker compose -f deploy/zimaos/docker-compose.yml config --quiet`) —
  **pass**.

## CI status (GitHub Actions)

- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push to `main`. Steps: install → lint → typecheck →
  test → production build → Docker image build → Compose validation (`docker compose config`).
- **Result for the correction-pass push — success.** Run `36282720203`, head SHA
  `2573f9e02f016a3106ffd0b9c842b9594597bf0e` (the correction-pass HEAD), conclusion **success**.
  CI does not depend on the disposable VM and contains no VM credentials.

## GHCR status

- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ghcr-publish.yml` on push to `main` (and `v*` tags), using the
  auto-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No VM dependency, no permanent registry credentials or PATs.
- **Result for the correction-pass push — success.** Run `36282720213`, head SHA
  `2573f9e02f016a3106ffd0b9c842b9594597bf0e` (the correction-pass HEAD), conclusion **success**.
- **Tags actually pushed (from the workflow log):** `latest` and immutable
  `sha-2573f9e02f016a3106ffd0b9c842b9594597bf0e`, both digest
  `sha256:f0b084a9…` (identical image — the immutable tag is a reproducible reference to exactly
  this build). This confirms the new commit-tag path works end-to-end in CI.
- **Tag strategy (implemented this pass):** every published build receives an immutable
  `sha-<GITHUB_SHA>` tag; pushes to `main` also publish `latest`; pushed `v*` release tags also
  publish the version tag and `latest`. Documented in README ("GHCR image references").
- **Package:** `ghcr.io/lvgvs/zimaos-mcp-server`, visibility **private** (inherits repository).
  Pulling requires a GitHub token with `read:packages` scope.

## Live integration status — full Phase 1 MCP matrix (authorized disposable VM)

Executed against ZimaOS v1.7.1 using `.env.integration.local` (never echoed; file remains
git-ignored and untracked). The server under test was the **production container artifact**
built from this repository's committed `Dockerfile`, run with `--env-file .env.integration.local`.

### Live API shape re-probe (RESEARCH.md reconciliation)

Secret-safe raw probe of the ZimaOS API (structure facts only; no credential values):

- `GET /v2/app_management/compose/{id}/containers` → HTTP 200 envelope containing **only**
  `{ data }` on live v1.7.1 (no `success`/`message`). `data = { main, containers }`;
  `containers` is a **map keyed by service name** (`nginx`), each value the container record
  (`ID`, `Name`, `Image`, `Service`, `State`, `Status`, `Health`, `Publishers`, ...). Not a flat
  array. Matches the implementation's normalizer.
- `GET /v2/app_management/compose/{id}/healthcheck` → HTTP **200** with a minimal body (no
  structured health-status data on this version); the HTTP status is the usable health signal,
  which is how `probeComposeAppHealth` treats it.

### Read path — all exercised through MCP (sanitized results)

- Unauthenticated `POST /mcp` → **401** (negative control).
- Authenticated `tools/list` → **9 tools**: `get_app`, `get_app_health`, `get_app_logs`,
  `get_system_info`, `list_app_containers`, `list_apps`, `restart_app`, `start_app`, `stop_app`.
- `list_apps` → 1 app: `mcp-test-nginx`, status `running`.
- `get_app` (`mcp-test-nginx`) → normalized details, status `running`.
- `get_app_health` → probe state **healthy**; 1 container (`nginx`, `running`).
- `get_app_logs` (bounded, `lines=20`) → non-empty bounded log text returned.
- `list_app_containers` → 1 container: service `nginx`, image `nginx:alpine`, state `running`,
  published port mapping present.
- `get_system_info` → real VM facts: hostname `ZimaOS`, OS version **v1.7.1**, arch `amd64`.

### Security / permissions — exercised through MCP

- Unauthenticated MCP request → **401** (above).
- With `ALLOW_APP_CONTROL=false`: `stop_app` returned the expected permission error
  `[APP_CONTROL_DISABLED] ... Set ALLOW_APP_CONTROL=true to enable it.` (tool-level error, no
  state change).

### Control path — exercised through MCP (`ALLOW_APP_CONTROL=true`)

Using the disposable test app `mcp-test-nginx`:

- `stop_app` → ok; polled status reached **exited** (~3 s).
- `start_app` → ok; polled status reached **running** (~3 s); health probe **healthy**.
- `restart_app` → ok (ZimaOS accepted the restart PUT); recovery verified: status **running**,
  health probe **healthy** on first poll. Note: ZimaOS recreates containers asynchronously and the
  compose-level status can read `running` throughout a fast recreation, so the stop transition was
  not separately observable in the final run; an earlier run did observe the intermediate
  container churn (port conflict during recreation) before recovery — consistent with async
  recreation, not a product defect.
- **Final state after all control operations:** `mcp-test-nginx` status **running**, health probe
  **healthy** — disposable test app restored to healthy/running as required.

## Documentation status

- Present: `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `docs/RESEARCH.md`, `STATUS.md`, `README.md`,
  `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `.env.example`, `deploy/zimaos/docker-compose.yml`.
- README documents: setup, configuration (all env vars incl. `ALLOW_APP_CONTROL` default-off), the
  exact MCP tool list (verified against `src/mcp/tools.ts`), **MCP client connection example**
  (Streamable HTTP endpoint URL + `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`, no real secrets),
  **GHCR tag strategy** (`latest`, `v*`, immutable `sha-<GITHUB_SHA>`), ZimaOS Custom App
  deployment via the paste-ready Compose, and the private-image pull limitation.

## Secrets / integration env file

- `.env.integration.local` is **ignored** (`.gitignore:9:.env.*`), **untracked**, and **unstaged**.
  No secrets are committed or staged; no credential values were printed in this session's logs,
  docs, or status. Verified with `git check-ignore -v .env.integration.local` → ignored.

## Known limitations

- GHCR image is private (inherits repo visibility); consumers need a token with `read:packages`.
  Documented in README; no action required for Phase 1 scope.
- A live ZimaOS Custom App paste/install through the ZimaOS UI remains the one optional manual
  verification item permitted by PROJECT.md; the Compose file is validated and paste-ready, but
  was not pasted into the VM's UI in this session.

## Manual actions required

- **None blocking.** No privileged or manual step is needed for Phase 1 completion.
- Optional: paste `deploy/zimaos/docker-compose.yml` into a ZimaOS Custom App on the disposable VM
  as an end-to-end UI verification (the container artifact itself is already verified).

## Recommended next action for the manager

Phase 1 is complete and pushed; review the handoff. No Phase 2 work has been started, per scope
discipline. If approved, a later phase may consider: public repository visibility decision, first
`v*` release tag (which will also exercise the new immutable `sha-<GITHUB_SHA>` + version-tag
publish path), and additional ZimaOS API coverage — none of which are in Phase 1 scope.
